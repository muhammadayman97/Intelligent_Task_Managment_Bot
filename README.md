# Intelligent_Task_Managment_Bot

This Project is a chatbot that acts as an assistant for nurses, which helps them get information from prescriptions

## Tools
I used Ollama to be able to run a LLMs on my local machine without needing high computing power, here I used Qwen model as my base model

## Example

### First we initialize a new conversation by adding a memory feature to the LLM to save the chat history which will be used to keep the conversation live as much as possible

### Then we can ask any question for the bot as follows

### Now we can send a prescription to the bot to extract information from it

### Sometimes it fails to get all the information from the first process, so here we asked about specific info and we got the answer as follows
